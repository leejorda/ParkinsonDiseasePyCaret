Parkinson’s disease is a disorder which affects an individual’s nervous system, often hindering basic human function: slowed movement, tremors, speech changes, muscle stiffness, and loss of automatic movements. While it cannot be cured, medical treatments can significantly improve these symptoms. This project uses PyCaret to apply several machine learning algorithms to the Parkinsons Telemonitoring dataset obtained from Oxford, to predict how much an individual is affected by Parkinson’s disease. Results show that the Extra Trees Regressor model performs the best, containing the lowest MSE, RMSE, R2, and RSMLE values.
